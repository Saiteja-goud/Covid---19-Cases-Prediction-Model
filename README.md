# Covid---19-Cases-Prediction-Model
The Covid-19 Case Prediction project is a Real Time project which is built using python notebook. This project is a Machine Learning Model Building Project.    A dataset which contains all the information regarding Covid-19 is loaded in the form of a CSV and is used for Model building.   A Linear Regressor and Random Forest Regressor model is built on the given data using Scikit Learn inbuilt modules. The data after fitted to the Machine Learning models is used to predict the Number of total cases that are going to be reported on a given future date.
